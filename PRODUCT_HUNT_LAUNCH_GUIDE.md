   ```

5. **First Comment** (Maker Introduction)
   ```
   Hey Product Hunt! üëã

   I'm Elky, founder of Smart Property Check.

   Property inspections are painful - they take 2-3 hours of typing notes,
   organizing photos, and writing reports. I built this after managing rental
   properties and wasting entire weekends on paperwork.

   What makes us different:
   ü§ñ AI Video Analysis - Record walkthrough videos, AI detects issues (industry first!)
   üìù Voice to Text - Speak your findings naturally, AI transcribes
   ‚ö° 30-Second Reports - AI writes professional PDF reports instantly
   ‚úçÔ∏è Digital Signatures - Get tenant/landlord signatures on-device
   üì± Native iOS - Works offline, syncs with iCloud

   We're live on the App Store with a 7-day free trial!

   Happy to answer any questions. What features would you want to see next?

   ‚Äî Elky
   ```

### Week 2-3: Build Your Hunter Relationship

**You need a "Hunter" to post your product.**

**Options:**
1. Ask a well-known founder/maker to hunt you (best)
2. Use your own account if you have followers
3. Self-hunt is fine for first-timers

**Popular Hunters:**
- Chris Messina (@chrismessina) - 100K+ followers
- Ryan Hoover (@rrhoover) - Founder of Product Hunt
- Find hunters in your niche (search for "property" or "real estate" products)

**How to ask:**
- DM on Twitter or Product Hunt
- Be genuine: "I've built X for Y audience, would you be interested in hunting it?"
- Show them the product first
- Don't be pushy - if they decline, self-hunt is fine

### Week 3-4: Build Your Launch Team

**Goal:** Get 50-100 upvotes in first 3 hours

**Recruit:**
- Friends & family (10-20 people)
- Beta users (if you have them)
- Twitter followers
- LinkedIn connections
- Other makers (offer to upvote their launches)
- Property management communities you're in

**Important Rules:**
- ‚ùå Don't spam or buy upvotes - PH detects this and will remove you
- ‚úÖ Personal messages work better than mass emails
- ‚úÖ Explain why their feedback matters
- ‚úÖ Give them the exact time to upvote (12:01 AM PST)

**Sample message:**
```
Hey [Name]!

I'm launching Smart Property Check on Product Hunt on [Date] at
12:01 AM PST. Would love your support!

Product Hunt ranks by upvotes in the first few hours, so timing matters.
If you could upvote and leave a comment around midnight PST, it would
help us reach more property managers who need this.

Here's what to do:
1. Go to producthunt.com at 12:01 AM PST on [Date]
2. Search for "Smart Property Check"
3. Click the upvote arrow (triangle)
4. Leave a comment if you have feedback!

Thanks! [Your link will be here]
```

## Questions to Consider

- [ ] Should we launch at v1.0 or wait for v1.1 team features?
- [ ] Do we have 5-10 beta users who can leave positive comments?
- [ ] Can we create a demo video for the gallery?
- [ ] Should we run a discount for PH users? (e.g., "PH50" code for 50% off first month)
